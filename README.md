# ✨ Glitter

`Glitter` is a tool that provides some shorcuts that I found useful for solo projects.

## Why?

Git can be very verbose some times and executing multiple commands just to do one thing gets tiring.

**For example**:

From this:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "my cool project"
git push
```

To this.

```sh
glitter push -m "my cool project"
```

Or this:

```sh
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/angelou6/glitter.git
git push -u origin main
```

To this:

```sh
glitter init
glitter publish -o https://github.com/angelou6/glitter.git
```

---

`Glitter` also has some small TUIs to help with publishing and staging:

| Stage                           | Publish                             |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| ![stage tui](/assets/stage.png) | ![publish tui](/assets/publish.png) |

## Example usage

```sh
# Initializing the repository and pushing it to GitHub
glitter init -m "my cool repo"
glitter publish -n glitter

# Pushing a fix
glitter push -m "fix: it compiles now"

# Amending the last push with new stuff
glitter push --amend

# Auto generate a commit message
glitter push

# Removing the lates push from remote
glitter undo push

# Opening the project in the default browser
glitter open

# Run replay
glitter replay play user
```

For more information on replays check [replay.md](REPLAY.md).

## Instalation

### Linux

Use the included [./install.sh](install.sh) script.

Here is the help message for that script:

```
-t	Target of the installation (default: ~/.local/bin)
-n	Name of the installed binary (default: glitter)
-u	Uninstall glitter
```

### Windows / Mac

Run `go install` or `go build` and place the binary wherever you want.

## Completions

To get completion working, run the following command:

```sh
glitter completion your-shell-here > completion-location-here/glitter
```

The completion location varies depending on the shell. Here are the locations of some popular shells:

- fish: `~/.config/fish/completions/`
- bash: `/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/` or `~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/`

## Dependencies

- git
- github-cli (optional for publishing on github)
